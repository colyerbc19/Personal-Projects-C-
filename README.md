# Personal-Projects-C-

This is a work in progress repository. As I work part time and do school full time, I do not have much time to work on personal projects. Every free moment I get I work on some fun games and other programs that are interesting to me. I will post the source code here and am open to suggestions and getting feedback for how I can improve. I also want more ideas of what I can do next.
